# Introduction

The following displays a range of projects that I have done since I started programming. They range from telegram bots to full on services that I have build with friends. My current interest is with React Native and learning how to design props such that developers will immediately understand without reading much of the doc. I am also obsessed with finding out how to build micro app architecture.
