## Problem

You are tasked to create a `full-page` bottom-sheet like experience to display some content within your React Native app. You wanted to use `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` for this use case, however there are some bugs and you need to swap `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` out for other libraries or find other techniques to achieve the same UI.

Today, we will explore how you can use `react-navigation` to achieve similar experience.

## Solution

To achieve what we want of a `full-page` bottom-sheet, you can use `react-navigation` with some params configured such that the page itself becomes a `modal`.

This will be crucial to the user experience because it provides the user with the ability to swipe to dismiss the page.

Apart from being a `modal`, you also need to provide some form of "darkened" background that is translucent, so that it indicates to the user it is a "bottom-sheet".
That is where the `cardOverlay: Overlay` comes into play. We will provide a component that is this "darkened" view.

Here is a snippet of how you should configure your `Screen`:

```javascript
<Stack.Screen
  name="Modal"
  component={ModalScreen}
  options={{
    ...TransitionPresets.ModalSlideFromBottomIOS, // provides bottom-up animation when launching page.
    presentation: 'transparentModal',
    cardOverlayEnabled: true,
    headerTitleAlign: 'center',
    headerShown: false,
    cardOverlay: Overlay,
  }}
/>
```

To let the user see the `Overlay` background, you have to have a transparent view within your page. Since we are doing a `full-page` bottom-sheet, we need set the height of this transparent view to be the safe area height.

Here is a snippet of the modal page:

```javascript
const ModalScreen = () => {
  const navigation = useNavigation<any>();

  const onClose = () => {
    navigation.canGoBack() && navigation.navigate('Home');
  };
  const top = useSafeAreaInsets().top;
  return (
    <View style={styles.root}>
      <View style={[{ height: top }, styles.emptyContainer]} />
      <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
        <View style={styles.modalHeaderContainer}>
          <Button title="close" onPress={onClose} />
          <Text>Hello World</Text>
          <Button title="save"></Button>
        </View>
        <Text>Hello</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};
```

Here is how the `full-page` bottom-sheet looks like:

<ReactPlayer
  playing
  controls
  url="/modal-page.mp4"
  height="100%"
  width="100%"
/>
