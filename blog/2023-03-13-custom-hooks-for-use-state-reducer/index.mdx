## Problem

There are times where you want to create your own custom hooks to be shared within your teammates or across projects. Usually there are 2 ways to write your custom hook.
You either return an object or a tuple.

1. Returning as an object

```
const useFirstName = () => {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");

  return {
    firstName,
    setFirstName
  }
}

```

Considering if you are returning as an object, you do not need to type it already because the object is inferred.

2. Returning as an array

```
const useFirstName = () => {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");

  return [firstName,setFirstName]
}
```

There will be some typescript issue with this because the array now becomes type of `const useFirstName: () => (string | React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string>>)[]
`.

So when you attempt to use the hook, you will realise that the type is `string | React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string>>`, which isn't what you want.

## Solution

`as const` to the rescue again!

```
const useFirstName = () => {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");

  return [firstName,setFirstName] as const
}
```

This will return the correct type for your `useFirstName` where specifically item 0 (your firstName) is of type `string` and item 1 will be your setter function.
