## Problem

Recently, I faced a dilemma when naming my react functions. I saw my colleagues named some functions as

```
onClickDate
onClickStartTime
onClickxxxx
```

To me previously, this was not acceptable because, I was thinking that when the user performed a certain action, then we trigger the function.
So I would name it as

```
onDateClicked
onStartTimeClicked
onXXXClicked
```

However, when I surveyed around with other senior engineers and did some googling, I realised that my idea of "correct" function names
has been wrong all these while. There should not be any `past tense` in your function names!

## Solution

Naming your functions in `present tense`. For eg:

```
onSelectDate
onSelectXXX

onSubmit
onConfirm

onChangeXXXX
onPressXXXX
```

To me code quality is very important which translate to naming your functions clearly. Moving forward, I shall stick to naming them with present tense for action related functions.
